# Frogger

This is a game design created by a tutorial with some additions of my own.

My Additions: 
- 
- Player name input
- Different lives option
- Speed option
- Start, Options, and Exit menues
- Exit, back, and play again options
- Borders so player cannot leave play area
- Despawn timer so birds do not clutter the game
